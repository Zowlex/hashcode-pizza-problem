# hashcode-pizza-problem
### This my first naive solution for my first time with google hashcode's practice round 2020
## 1. Problem statement
The problem is stated in the pdf file and you have to submit 6 files (1 for source code and 5 test cases)

## 2. Solution
solution function in *sub.py*
The solution is simple (it took me a couple of hours though) but in a nutshell it finds the maximum number of pizza slices that could be ordered from each type by choosing from the biggest pizza(the one with the most slices) down to the smallest one(the one with the least slices)

## 3. How to run
`write_sub.py filename.in` => takes input_file (test case) and writes the output to `filename.out`  then you upload it in the submission and score part

## 4. Score

## 5. Submission
It took me 2 or 3 submissions where I had to fix some bugs (like "pizza 48 appeared twice") where I had to remove each occurence of the ordered pizza once its done
